# About This Site

This is a fork of the [nanoc3 Blog Starter Kit](https://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog/) by Mario L. Gutierrez. His template provides an excellent starting point but lacks only a richer CSS styling framework. So this project adds the following features:

1. [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) integration with the [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/sporkd/compass-html5-boilerplate) extension
2. The [Susy](https://github.com/ericam/compass-susy-plugin) semantic CSS grid plugin for Compass

The main features of the original project are preserved, such as the handling of articles and archives, tag pages, and DISQUS integration. However, there are some some fixes too - Such as those mentioned in this [article by Chris Kempson](http://chriskempson.com/2011/02/01/blogging-with-nanoc3-blog-starter-kit.html).

This project is hosted on github at https://github.com/cearley/nanoc3_blog.
